Implies an uncertainty due to energy calibration of ~ 0.75%.  It would be good for me to run
the simulations whcih predicted that again, because I think this uncertainty will be smaller now
that energy fluctionuations are bounded at 0.15 MeV, rather than 0.2 MeV. Also, there
is a lot of Y(2S) data which was dedicated to tightening our knowledge of energy calibration fluctuations.

BTW, these are fluctuations within a scan, not from week to week. Fluctuations from week to week
have no bias, since I fit each week separately .
