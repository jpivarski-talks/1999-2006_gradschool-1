Continuum hadrons and tau pairs are cunerrrrently uncertain because of how ISR
correctinos to cross-section should be handled.  Two-photon is modelled by a toy MC (by Karl B.)
and is still preliminary.  Im might hanchange my cuts to eliminate two-photon instead.
(Unlike the other soucrces, it introduces a bias.)
