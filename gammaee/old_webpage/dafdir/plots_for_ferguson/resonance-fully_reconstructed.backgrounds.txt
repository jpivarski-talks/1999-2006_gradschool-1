Preliminatry measurements of off-resonance bakcgrounds.  In parens are the
percent biases to area measuremnent

Anything that scales as 1/s has zero bias becuase my fit function includes a 1/s pedistal.

Note that U(3S) -> tau tau is the most destructive, even though it is the smallest.

beamgas and cosmics will depend on run number, but I modelled them here as flat. (not 1/s)

Cosmics are MUCH smaller than 0.04... I'll get to that soon (probably not before your talk, though)
