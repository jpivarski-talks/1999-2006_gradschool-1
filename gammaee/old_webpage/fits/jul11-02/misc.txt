For 127601, 127602, 127606, don't use the database values, even the
update database. Use the values Matt gave you (in run_infoY2s.html).

That +3 point ambiguity is not an artifact of update versus beginRun.
I checked all the update records for this run (127606 is really funky,
but Matt knows about it).
