The file `/home/mccann/public_html/upsilons_in_cleo3.dat` (also to be
found at http://www.lepp.cornell.edu/~mccann/upsilons_in_cleo3.dat)
contains the following:

RUNNUMBER   RESONANCE   BEAMENERGY   NUMBEROFUPSILONS   STATISTICALERROR

where $1 RUNNUMBER         is the 6-digit run number
      $2 RESONANCE         is 1, 2, or 3 for U(nS)--- including nearby off-resonance!
      $3 BEAMENERGY        is the single-beam energy in GeV (~5)
      $4 NUMBEROFUPSILONS  is the number of Upsilons that decayed during that run
      $5 STATISTICALERROR  is the statistical error in the above number
                           (I will discuss systematic error near the
                            bottom of this document.)

The number of Upsilons is efficiency corrected, so it represents the
number of decays that happened, not the number that were seen in the
detector.  It was calculated like this:

(number of hadrons) -
     (gg luminosity)/(continuum sample lumi) * (number of hadrons in continuum sample)
                            * ((continuum energy) / (run energy))^2

all divided by the hadronic efficiency (99.05%, 96.95%, 96.80% for 1S, 2S, 3S)

all divided by (1 - 3 Bmumu)

where Bmumu is the branching fraction to muons (all leptons, assuming
lepton universality).  I use Istvan's new measurements:
(2.49 +/- 0.07)% (1S),   (2.03 +/- 0.09)% (2S),   (2.39 +/- 0.12)% (3S)

The gamma-gamma luminosity is used rather than bhabha because the
RunInfo bhabha luminosity doesn't have Upsilon --> e+ e- subtracted
off.  This makes a few percent difference as you pass through a large
resonance, particularly the U(1S).  Gamma-gamma has a larger
statistical error but at least it's unbiased.

The list contains ALL runs in datasets 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25,
and 27 with beam energy between 4.71 GeV and 5.205 GeV (that have been
pass2'ed).  If you are looking for a run that isn't in the list, it
has a way-wrong energy, and couldn't possibly contain any Upsilons
(maybe it's a Lambda_b scan point).

Some of the runs were used in the continuum subtraction mentioned
above--- it would be statistically wrong to count Upsilons from them
since the calculation of the number of Upsilons depends on them.
Therefore, these entries in `upsilons_in_cleo3.dat' return 10^20 with
-1 as an uncertainty to punish your job if you do so.  Hopefully, if
you mistakenly include one of them, you will be puzzled by the results
and find your error.  These runs make up the continuum sample, for the
U(1S):

There are runs in `upsilons_in_cleo3.dat' which are significantly
off-resonance (both above and below) which were NOT used in the
continuum subtraction.  You are free to count Upsilons from these
runs, though they are statistically consistent with zero.  If you want
to restrict yourself to on-resonance runs in your analysis, here are
some beam energy ranges to use.

Widest reasonable ranges:
   4.72625 -- 4.735 (1S)     5.009 -- 5.0165 (2S)    5.175 -- 5.184 (3S)
(These will include a lot of scan points, down to about a quarter- or
an eigth-maximum (meaning: well beyond half-maximum).  If you are
worried about your final state interfereing with continuum processes,
you may not want to leave the window so wide.)

Peak energies:
        4.73019 (1S)            5.01285 (2S)             5.1792 (3S)
(You can decide for yourself how wide to make a window, but these are
the centers of the peaks.  About 90% of the runs should be within an
MeV or two of these.  Resonance-continuum interference passes through
zero at the peak.)

--- SYSTEMATIC ERRORS --- Systematic Errors --- systematic errors ---

The continuum subtraction involves a sufficiently large block of runs
that counting statistics of hadrons and gamma-gammas account for only
a 0.1% error.

Much bigger is the efficiency correction, which includes a 0.58%,
0.77%, 0.81% error for U(1S), U(2S), and U(3S).  There's a CBX coming
out on this measurement soon.  I made two physics assumtions: lepton
universality (again), and I assumed there are no non-Standard Model
Upsilon decays with more than 65% missing energy.  Depending on your
analysis, you might differ with the second assumtion.  If you do,
increase the efficiency uncertainties to 1.22%, 1.49%, and 2.03%.

The gamma-gamma luminosity has a 2.5% systematic error, but it is only
being used in ratios.  Jean Duboscq finds a scatter of at most 1.1%
when continuum-subtracting tau events in data11, and since I'll be
studying this thoroughly very soon, I will use this number as a
systematic error right now.

The Bmumu error is in the denominator, but when the error is
propogated to the 1/(1-3B) factor which is multiplied to the result,
the uncertainties in this factor are 0.25%, 0.31%, and 0.42%.  Before
the efficiency correction, a small remnant of Upsilon --> tau+ tau-
had to be subtracted (1.5% of the total).  The uncertainty in Bmumu
was not counted twice.

After cuts and continuum subtraction, 0.05% of the events are
two-photon fusion (they don't scale as 1/s) and as a worst case,
+/-0.5% of the events are beam-gas, beam-wall, and cosmic rays.  The
first background is ignored and the second is treated as a systematic
error, as it may be positive or negative (there may have been more
junk in the continuum subtraction than the on-resonance run).

All the systematic errors added together are:

             1.4% (1S)      1.5% (2S)      1.5% (3S)

of the total number of Upsilons counted.

world.
