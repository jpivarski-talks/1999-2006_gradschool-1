This is the README file for TwoPhotonCuts. It shows you how to write
a Processor in the new CLEO3 Suez environment.

1.) You should only need to edit the TwoPhotonCuts.cc file (and
    potentially also TwoPhotonCuts.h). Fill TwoPhotonCuts.cc with your
    analysis code.

2.) Make a shared library: "gmake CXX=<compiler>"
This step requires that you have a standard type of build area,
consisting of (../bin, ../lib, and ../shlib) directories.
The shared processor library will end up in ../shlib!

3.) Set the environment variable C3_SHLIB to include the ../shlib
directory above: setenv C3_SHLIB /home/mkl/build/shlib

4.) A tcl file to load your processor called loadTwoPhotonCuts.tcl is
    located in TwoPhotonCuts's Test subdirectory.  It includes any other
    packages needed for the auto-generated example code.

5.) Start up Suez: suez

6.) Here is a sample job:

suez> file in test.rp
suez> proc ls

Listing all available Processors:

in memory:

and on disk:
/home/mkl/build/shlib/ TwoPhotonCuts

suez> run_file loadTwoPhotonCuts.tcl
suez> go 1
... 
suez> exit
