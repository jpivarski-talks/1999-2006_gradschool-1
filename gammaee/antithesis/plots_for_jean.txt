Three resonances on one plot, all with the same-sized axes.  It comes
in many different aspect ratios.

Individual plots of 1S, 2S, and 3S, with and without an inset showing
the high-energy tail point.  (It's interesting to know that we still
observe the effect of the resonance 50 MeV above its mass, though it
may be too minor of a point to bring up in your talk.)  There are two
choices of aspect ratio. (I wanted to generate anything that you'd
need while the data is still in memory.)

Two Feynman diagrams, one for Gamma_ee and the other for f_B.  Set
them to have the same height, and the fonts and everything will look
right.
