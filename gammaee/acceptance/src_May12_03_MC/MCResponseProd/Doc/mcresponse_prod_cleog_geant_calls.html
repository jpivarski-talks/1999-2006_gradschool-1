<h1> Cleog and Geant calls by the MCResponseProd Producer </h1>
<ul>
  <li> setup_geant_() <br>
       called in the MCResponseProd constructor. <p>

  <li> set_geant_run_() <br>
       called by <code>MCResponseProd::updateCleogBeginRun</code> - tells
       Geant what the run number is which is set by the Suez system. <p>
       
  <li> setup_kuip_() <br>
       called by <code>MCResponseProd::updateCleogBeginRun</code> after
       the geometry is created if the user has set the Suez run time
       parameter <code>UseKuip true</code>.  The KUIP interface is
       available to Geant/Cleog "experts".  Standard running of cleog
       will not require KUIP and most users will only use the Suez
       interface. <p>
       
  <li> cleog_update_br_() <br>
       Cleog update begin run constants. <p>
       
  <li> usbrun_() <br>
       Geant user begin run routine. <p>
       
  <li> cleog_trig_() <br>
       Routine that triggers Geant for the event.  This replaces cgtrig
       to avoid a name conflict. <p>
       
  <li> uglast_() <br>
       Geant user end of job call, called in the MCResponseProd
       destructor. <p>
       
  <li> paexit_() <br>
       CERN routine to exit & cleanup from paw, called in the MCResponseProd destructor.

</ul>
