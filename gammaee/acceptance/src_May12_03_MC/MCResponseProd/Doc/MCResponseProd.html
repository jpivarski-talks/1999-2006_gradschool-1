<h1> MCResponseProd Library </h1>

This library serves the 
<a href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/development/src/MCResponse/Doc/MCResponse.html">
MCResponse</a> objects (these correspond to the RAWM banks in Cleo-II) and
currently contains all of the calls to Geant.
The coupling to Geant isn't ideal,
but is necessary now.  See the section on <a href="#geant">Geant</a>
below for the details.
<p>

The response objects are filled by the MCxxResponseProxy objects for
sub-detector xx. These objects first trigger the filling of the GEANT
hits banks via <code>triggerGeantEvent()</code>, and then call
a Fortran subroutine (mc_xx_responses.F) which fetch the GEANT
hits, cycle through them, and collate the necessary information
needed for the MCxxResponse objects.  <P>

The method by which the Fortran code (located in the
<CODE>/Fortran</CODE> subdirectory) fills the table of responses has
been implemented in one of two ways: either an "on-the-fly" filling of
the table from Fortran which is called for each Response object (via a
static function which knows how to fill the object), or a
"bulk-insertion" filling method called after the Fortran routine
calculates all of responses (in which fixed-length arrays are supplied
to Fortran to fill). The latter method requires that the Fortran
routine must check that it is not exceeding the array bounds and has the
possibility of overflowing the arrays.  The former method is a bit
tricky to understand at first, but avoids the problem of overflowing
the arrays.

<h1> Running Cleog under Suez </h1>
See the document on  <a href="running_cleog_in_suez.html">running_cleog_in_suez.html</a>.
Also, see the 
<a href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/scripts/cleo3mc">
script to run cleo3 MC</a> - QQ and Cleog under suez, 
this calls the tcl script

<h1> Geant </h1>
Currently, this library is coupled to Geant because we read the hits
that Geant produces via Fortran common blocks (accessed via Geant
routine GFHITS which reads the Zebra common blocks).  The future plan is
to create C++ objects ( with the tentative name <code>MCTrace</code>
which Paul Avery has worked on)
to hold the Geant hit information.  Then the MCResponseProd can extract
these objects from the Frame and all references to Geant can be moved to
a Geant specific producer.  When this happens, the MCResponseProd can
read MCResponse objects that have been created by Cleog or a "Fast" MC.

<h1> Cleog/Geant Initialization </h1>
See <a href="Cleog_under_Suez_Geant_notes.html">
Cleog_under_Suez_Geant_notes.html</a> for notes on how we initialize
Geant and Cleog when running under Suez.


<p>
<br>
<h1> Geometry </h1>
Cleog defines the Geant geometry using the Cleo3 geometry system - the
<a href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/restricted/CLEO/CLEO3/soft/LibraryDocs/DetectorGeometry.html">
Detector Geometry</a> and the the extra Geant
specific info - G3iExtraVolSpecsStore, which is documented in the
<a href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/development/src/Geant3Interface/Doc/Geant3Interface.html">
Geant3Interface library</a>.
The object
<A href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/development/src/MCResponseProd/Class/BuildGeantGeometry.h">
<code>BuildGeantGeometry.h</code></A>
 makes the calls to the 
detector geometry and Geant3Interface packages.
See the writeup on <a href="BuildGeantGeometry.html">BuildGeantGeometry</a>
