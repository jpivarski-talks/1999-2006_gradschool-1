<h1> What a MCxxResponseProxy Does </h1>

Some general info on the MCxxResponseProxy proxies.  Each proxy holds a
pointer to the MCResponseProd producer through which it calls the
producer's methods.  The proxies are bindable proxies and are bound to
the beginRun record to make sure that Cleog has the correct constants
for this run number which is done via <code>updateBeginRun()</code>.
<p>

The MCxxResponseProxy.cc proxies are bindable proxies 
inorder to update Cleog's begin run data.  The proxy's
method <code>updateBeginRun()</code> are bound to the BeginRun stream; 
this calls the MCResponseProd method
<code>updateBeginRun()</code> to determines if Cleog's begin run
data needs to be updated.
<p>

The proxy's method <code>invalidateCache()</code> calls the
MCResponseProd producer method <code>invalidateGeantEvent()</code>
which tells the producer we need to trigger Geant for the next event
and deletes the ptrTable of the MCxxResponse objects.
<p>


The proxy's <code>faultHandler()</code> method determines if Geant needs
to be triggered and then creates the MCResponse objects.  The proxy
first calls the MCResponseProd method <code>triggerGeantEvent()</code>
which triggers Geant for the event if needed.  Then the MC Responses are
created for the event via a call to Fortran subroutine
<code>mc_xx_reponses_()</code> for sub-detector xx.  The Fortran
subroutines pass the MC Response info back to the C++ proxy using the
"on-the-fly" or "bulk-insertion" method (see above) and the proxy
creates the MCxxResponse objects.  This is illustrated by the
diagram below.

The figures from xfig will not show correctly in ghostview but
should print fine (although xfig isn't WYSIWYG so there might
be minor problems).
