This document explains the functioning of the 
<CODE>Geant3MaterialsMediaProd</CODE> library.

<P>
This library is designed to work in tandem with the
<A href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/development/src/Geant3Interface/Doc/Geant3Interface.html">
<CODE>Geant3Interface</CODE></A> library.
It is a <CODE>Suez</CODE> producer and has proxies for
<CODE>FATable&lt;DGConstMaterialPtr&gt;</CODE> (the
<A href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/restricted/CLEO/CLEO3/soft/LibraryDocs/DetectorGeometry.html">
<CODE>DetectorGeometry</CODE></A> 
store for material pointers) and
<CODE>FATable&lt;<A
href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/development/src/Geant3Interface/Geant3Interface/G3iTrackingMedium.h">G3iTrackingMedium</A>&gt;</CODE> 
(the store for Geant3 tracking media).
</P>

<P>
  For an introduction to the use of materials, see the
documentation for the 
<A href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/development/src/MaterialDelivery/Doc/MaterialDelivery.html">
<CODE>MaterialDelivery</CODE></A> library.

<H3>Material Creation and Definition</A></H3>
<P>
The requirements on material specification and definition
are set by both GEANT3 and Kalman tracking needs. On the
one hand, the Kalman fitting of charged tracks needs
to know the properties of all objects within the tracking volume;
hence the requirement that each 
<A href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/restricted/CLEO/CLEO3/soft/LibraryDocs/DetectorGeometry.html">
<CODE>DetectorGeometry</CODE></A> 
shaped volume have a material specified. On the other hand
GEANT3 must have all the materials defined and
installed inside its common blocks via specific Fortran calls.
</P>

<P>
   The creation of the source information for a <CODE>DGMaterialStore</CODE>
is performed by
<A href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/development/src/Geant3MaterialsMediaProd/Class/DGConstMaterialPtrProxy.cc">
<CODE>DGConstMaterialPtrProxy.cc</CODE></A>
in this library. It fills the 
<CODE>FAPtrTable&lt;DGConstMaterialPtr&gt;</CODE> from the member
functions of the singleton object defined by
<A href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/development/src/Geant3MaterialsMediaProd/Geant3MaterialsMediaProd/G3iMakeMaterials.h">
<CODE>G3iMakeMaterials.h</CODE></A>, which in turn makes
Geant3 calls to determine material properties.
</P>

<P>
The structure of <A href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/development/src/Geant3MaterialsMediaProd/Geant3MaterialsMediaProd/G3iMakeMaterials.h">
<CODE>G3iMakeMaterials.h</CODE></A> and
 <A href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~cleo3/development/src/Geant3MaterialsMediaProd/Class/G3iMakeMaterials.cc">
<CODE>G3iMakeMaterials.cc</CODE></A>
deserves some explanation. First of all, the class is a singleton
because the GEANT3 calls can be made exactly once without
errors. Next, although there is the flexibility to create an
arbitrary material with any radiation length, we have chosen
in all cases (so far!) to define real materials with real
elements and let GEANT3 compute the resulting radiation and
absorption lengths. For each GEANT3 material one needs to
specify the number of elements it is composed of, the
atomic number and weight of each of those elements, the
proportion of each element by weight or by atomic counting,
and the density of the material. One must be careful not
to create mixtures of other mixtures because in this case
only the "weighted average" Z and A of the mixture is
used in the computation of radiation and absorption lengths,
*not* the actual Z's and A's of all the components of the
mixture. For example, one can define Propane as 3 Carbons
and 8 Hydrogens, and then 60-40 Helium-Propane as 60%
Helium by partial pressure and 40% Propane, but this would
be incorrect. One needs to define 60-40 Helium-Propane
as the appropriately weighted mixture of Helium, Carbon, and
Hydrogen. And get the density right.
