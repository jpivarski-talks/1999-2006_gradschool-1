After cut: 6\% of continuum is two-photon.  $1/s$ versus $\log s$
correction is a $\frac{1}{2}$\% correction to continuum scale factor.
Propogating this scale factor uncertainty after all cuts: 0.01\%,
0.03\%, 0.04\% two-photon contamination in continuum-subtracted
$\Upsilon$ dataset.

In detailed studies, surviving non-beam-beam is -0.05\%, -0.11\%,
-0.27\%, but this is from a subsample of the data.  What about all
data?

BEFORE continuum subtraction (some of these runs are continuum):

The same thing histogrammed:

Biggest scan contamination: 1.0\% (next is 0.8\%\ldots)

Add up ALL on-, off-resonance, do continuum subtraction, remaining
non-beam-beam background is -0.0029 nb, -0.00068 nb, -0.0025 nb.

Hadronized thrust axis (generator level) is $1 - 0.023(\pm 0.016)
\cos^2\theta$: consistent with being flat.  Looking for $+0.32$,
violated by 20$\sigma$.
