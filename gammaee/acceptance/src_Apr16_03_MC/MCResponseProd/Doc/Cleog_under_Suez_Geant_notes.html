<h1> Initialization of Geant and Cleog Under Suez </h1>
This note documents how we initialize Geant and Cleog when running Cleog under
Suez.  Currently, the MCResponseProd library is coupled to Geant as
the routines that read the Geants hits get them by reading Fortran
common blocks (by calling <code>GFHITS</code> which reads to Zebra banks - which are
common blocks).  The Cleo3 standard says one cannot use Fortran common
blocks for intermodule communication; therefore all Geant calls are
made from the MCResponseProd library.  In the future, we will create
C++ objects to replace reading the hits from <code>GFHITS</code>,
and the MCResponseProd library will be independent of Geant.  At that
time, we will move the Geant calls to another producer and then 
the MCResponeProd can be used with a "fast" Monte Carlo simulation.

The figures from xfig will not show correctly in ghostview but
should print (although xfig is not WYSIWYG so there might
be minor problems).

<h1> Description of <code>SETUP_GEANT</code> </h1>
The Fortran subroutine <code>setup_geant</code> is called
by the Suez producer <code>MCResponseProd</code> constructor.
<code>setup_geant</code> replaces the Geant main routine,
<code>guser_suez/gxint_321/gxint.F</code> and
<code>guser_suez/gxint_321/gpaw.F</code>.
The calls in <code>gxint</code> sets up the
Zebra common block size & calls guser_suez/gxint_321/gpaw.F to
initialize Geant.

<br>


<h1> Description of <code>USER_GEANT_INIT</code> </h1>
The Geant user initialization is done by the subroutine
<code>USER_GEANT_INIT</code>, 
which replaces <code>UGINIT</code> (to avoid
name conficts with the current UGINIT).  This routine
is based on the example given in the
<a href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asdoc/geant_html3/geantall.html">
Geant 3.21 manual</a> (although the example code only exists
in the postscript version of the manual, go figure).
The Geant geometry is not defined at this point as it
is done at begin run time.  <code>CLEOG_INIT</code>
is called to initialize Cleog specific code.
<p>
<br>

<h1> Description of <code>CLEOG_INIT</code> </h1>
This routine initializes Cleo specific code for Cleog.
Currently calls are made to Zfiles, I/O related calls,
QQ, the B field, etc.

<br>

<h1> Geant Geometry Definitions </h1>
The Geant geometry is not built at initialization time
but at begin run time as there are geometry constants that
vary with run number.  The object <code>BuildGeantGeometry</code>
creates the Geant geometry
and is called by <code>MCResponseProd::updateCleogBeginRun</code>.
The <code>BuildGeantGeometry</code> object makes calls to the Cleo3
geometry system - the detector geometry
(DGDetectorStore) and the extra Geant
specific info (G3iExtraVolSpecsStore).
